# PageRank
Algorithm Implementations of Page Rank Algorithms.

Flow Formulation deals with simple graphs without dead ends and spider traps.
Code for Flow Formulation is available in R and Pyhton.This uses dense matrices.

Matrix Formulation is advanced version where spidertraps, dead ends and self-loops are all handled.
Code for Matrix Formulation is available in R, Python and Spark(Distributed Version). Both sparse and dense matrix approaches are available
